// Given a positive integer n, find the length of its Collatz sequence. The Collatz sequence is generated sequentially where

// n = n / 2 if n is even
// n = 3 * n + 1 if n is odd
// And the sequence ends if n = 1
// Example 1
// Input
// n = 11
// Output
// 15
// Explanation
// The Collatz sequence is: [11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1] and its length is 15.
