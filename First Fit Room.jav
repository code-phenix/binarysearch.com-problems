/*You are given a list of integers rooms and an integer target. Return the first integer in rooms that's target or larger. If there is no solution, return -1.

Constraints

0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of rooms
Example 1
Input
rooms = [15, 10, 30, 50, 25]
target = 20
Output
30
Explanation
30 is the first room that's at least as large as 20.

Example 2
Input
rooms = [15, 10, 30, 50, 25]
target = 51
Output
-1
Explanation
There's no room that's at least 51.*/
